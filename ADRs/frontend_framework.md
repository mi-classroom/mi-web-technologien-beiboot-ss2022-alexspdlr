# Frontend-Framework: React

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The future scope and requirements of the application are still uncertain. One could consider preventing this potential problem by using a flexible framework.

## Decision

- Use React.js

## Consequences

- React is very widely used and therefore offers a large amount of documentation, packages and community support
- React is developed and maintained by Facebook, which on the one hand promises a high quality of the framework, but on the other hand makes the project dependent on the decisions of a single company in the long term
