# Hosting: Heroku

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The project must already be accessible online in its initial version.

## Decision

- Use Heroku

## Consequences

- As an established service provider for hosting web applications, heroku takes care of most of the work related to the deployment of the application
- The reliance on a single company is even greater in this case compared to the chosing a frontend framework
- One is bound to the free tier offered by heroku or has to decide in the future, depending on the requirements, if it is worth to buy an upgrade or to switch the hosting provider
